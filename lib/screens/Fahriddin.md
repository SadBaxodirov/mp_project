### Fahriddin – Auth & Profile

- Designed and implemented the full **auth flow**: login, registration, and profile, including all form validation and UX.
- Set up **app bootstrap & guarded navigation** so the app:
    - Restores JWTs on startup.
    - Chooses home vs login based on auth state.
    - Protects authenticated routes.
- Built the **login experience**:
    - Username/password validation.
    - Integration with the `/token/` endpoint.
    - Loading and error handling (inline + SnackBar).
- Built the **registration experience**:
    - Collects full student profile (name, school, grade, phone, email, password).
    - Validates phone format (`+998…`), password strength, and confirmation.
    - Calls `/user/register/` and auto-logs in on success.
- Created the **profile page UI/UX**:
    - Gradient header, avatar with initials, school/grade chips, stats cards.
    - “Edit info” bottom sheet to update profile fields and refresh the current user.
- Implemented **token handling & backend wiring**:
    - Login/register/update/logout orchestration.
    - Attaching and refreshing JWT tokens for authenticated API calls.
- Integrated **test statistics into the profile**:
    - Fetches the user’s tests from the backend.
    - Computes and displays averages, last test date, and per-subject breakdown.
- Added **local avatar support**:
    - Pick profile photos from the gallery.
    - Store them locally per user (no server upload).
